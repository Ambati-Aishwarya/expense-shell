# expense-shell
this repo contains automation of expense-shell using bash-scripting.

golden rules to be followed when automating the manual process

1. code should be dry
2. logs should not be displayed on the screen
3. it should always show whether the step is succesful or not
4. when you rerun the script from the second time on the same server, it should be qualified.
Areas of improvements
1.if condition is used multiple times ,let's try to put it as a function and call that as needed
DRY(Dont repeat yourself)WET(Write everything twice)are software engineering principles that describe how to write code.Dry code is prefered because its easier to maintain and scale
