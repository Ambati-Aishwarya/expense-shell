# expense-shell
this repo contains automation of expense-shell using bash-scripting.

golden rules to be followed when automating the manual process

1. code should be dry
2. logs should not be displayed on the screen
3. it should always show whether the step is succesful or not
4. when you rerun the script from the second time on the same server, it should be qualified.
